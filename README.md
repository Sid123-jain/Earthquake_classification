General Instructions
Codebase:
The Python code remains the same for all five datasets. Just provide a different dataset to get respective results for each region.

Download Notebook:
Download the .ipynb file named Earthquake_classification.ipynb.

Setup Google Colab:

Open Google Colab

Set the runtime to T4 GPU

Upload the downloaded notebook

Load Regional Dataset:
Replace the dataset link in the notebook with your target region’s dataset. The code will adapt automatically.

Run the Notebook:
Execute the cells step-by-step, or use Runtime > Run all to run the entire notebook at once.

Evaluate the Model:
Check the performance metrics — Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, MCC, and K-Score — to validate the model.

Save the Best Model (Optional):
Export and download the best-performing model for future use or integration.

Deploy Your Model:
Easily deploy the trained model using Streamlit or Flask for web-based interaction.
